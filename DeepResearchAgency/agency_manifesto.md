# Deep Research Agency Workflow

## Agent Flow
1. **Triage Agent** - Determines if clarification is needed
2. **Clarifying Agent** - Gathers additional context (if needed)
3. **Instruction Builder Agent** - Enriches queries for comprehensive research
4. **Research Agent** - Performs web search + internal document search

## Key Principles
- **Cookbook aligned** - Based on OpenAI Deep Research patterns
- **Beginner-friendly** - Simple Agency Swarm v1.x implementation
- **Factual research** - Web search + internal knowledge via MCP
- **Clean handoffs** - Each agent focuses on their specific role
